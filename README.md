## Healthcare-Expenditure-Mortality-Rate
Analyzing the Relationship Between Healthcare Expenditure and Mortality Rates in Countries

#Description:
This project aims to investigate the correlation between the amount of money spent on healthcare in a country and its mortality rates. By analyzing datasets, we seek to understand how variations in healthcare expenditure may impact overall mortality rates, considering different countries and their respective healthcare systems.

#Key User Group:
Health economists, policymakers, and public health researchers interested in understanding the relationship between healthcare spending and mortality outcomes on a global scale.

#User Objectives:
Users aim to gain insights into the potential association between healthcare expenditure and mortality rates. Understanding the financial impact on health outcomes can inform healthcare policy decisions and resource allocation strategies.

#Visualization using a Choropleth map:
Choosing a choropleth map for visualizing the relationship between healthcare expenditure as a percentage of government expenditure and mortality rates in countries is highly effective and efficient. This visualization leverages geographical context, utilizing color gradients to distinguish values and enabling easy comparison across countries.
